Gryphon Healthcare data breach settlement claim form and paperwork for medical records exposure compensation

      <h1>Gryphon Healthcare Data Breach Settlement: Did Your Medical Info Get Exposed? Here's How to Get Paid</h1>
<p><strong>Deadline: April 16, 2026</strong></p>
<p><em>Last Updated: February 10, 2026</em></p>
<p>Okay, real talk: if you got a confusing letter about a "data incident" from <strong>Gryphon Healthcare</strong>—a medical billing company that handles patient records for healthcare providers across the country—you're probably wondering what it means and whether you should care.</p>
<p>Short answer: <strong>Yes, you should care.</strong> In July 2024, hackers accessed Gryphon's systems and stole private medical information including Social Security numbers, health insurance data, and patient diagnoses. And yes, you can get paid for it through this class action settlement—no matter what state you live in.</p>
<p>Let's break down what happened, who's eligible, and how to actually get your money without needing a law degree.</p>
<h2>Quick Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>What happened:</strong> Hackers broke into Gryphon Healthcare's system in July 2024 and stole medical records</li>
<li><strong>What was exposed:</strong> Names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, medical diagnoses, prescriptions, insurance info</li>
<li><strong>Who can file:</strong> Anyone whose info was in the breach (you probably got a letter) - <strong>nationwide, not just Texas</strong></li>
<li><strong>What you get:</strong> Cash payment (amount not announced yet)</li>
<li><strong>Deadline:</strong> April 16, 2026</li>
<li><strong>Official site:</strong> <a href="https://gryphonhealthcaredatasettlement.com/">GryphonHealthcareDataSettlement.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This healthcare data breach settlement affects patients nationwide whose protected health information (PHI) was exposed when cybercriminals accessed Gryphon Healthcare's systems. If you received a notice about the July 2024 security incident involving your medical billing records, you're entitled to compensation under this class action settlement agreement.</p>
<h2>What Is Gryphon Healthcare? (And Why Do They Have My Info?)</h2>
<p>Gryphon Healthcare is a medical billing company. You've probably never heard of them because they work behind the scenes for doctors' offices and hospitals all over the country.</p>
<p>When you go to the doctor, someone has to handle the paperwork and send bills to your insurance company. That's what Gryphon does. Which means they had access to a lot of sensitive information about a lot of people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, hackers figured that out too.</p>
<h2>What Information Was Stolen in the Gryphon Healthcare Cyberattack?</h2>
<p>The July 2024 data breach compromised sensitive patient information stored in Gryphon's medical billing systems. If you received treatment from any healthcare provider that used Gryphon for billing services, your private health data may have been exposed to unauthorized access.</p>
<h2>What Happened in the Data Breach?</h2>
<p>In <strong>July 2024</strong>, hackers broke into Gryphon's computer system. They got into files that contained:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>Date of birth</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li><strong>Social Security number</strong> (the big one)</li>
<li>Medical diagnoses</li>
<li>What medications you take</li>
<li>Your health insurance info</li>
<li>When you went to the doctor</li>
<li>Your medical record number</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, everything you wouldn't want a random stranger to know about your health and personal life.</p>
<h2>Am I Affected? How Do I Know?</h2>
<p><strong>If you got a letter from Gryphon Healthcare, you're affected.</strong></p>
<p>The letter probably said something like "Notice of Data Incident" or had a lot of legal language that made your eyes glaze over. (We don't blame you—these things are written like homework assignments from the world's most boring teacher.)</p>
<p>If you <strong>didn't</strong> get a letter but you went to a doctor or hospital that uses Gryphon for billing, you might still be eligible. Check the settlement website to see if your information was included.</p>
<h2>Do I Have to Live in Texas to File a Claim?</h2>
<p><strong>No!</strong> This is important: even though the lawsuit was filed in Texas court (Harris County, to be specific), <strong>you can file a claim from anywhere in the United States.</strong></p>
<p>Gryphon handled medical billing for healthcare providers across the country, so the breach affected people nationwide. If your information was in their system, you're eligible—whether you live in Texas, California, New York, or anywhere else.</p>
<p>The lawsuit just happens to be in Texas because that's where the plaintiffs filed it. Don't let that confuse you.</p>
<h2>What's the Settlement About?</h2>
<p>A group of people sued Gryphon, basically saying: "Hey, you were supposed to keep our medical info safe, and you didn't. That's not okay."</p>
<p>Gryphon said, "We didn't do anything wrong" (they always say that), but they agreed to settle the lawsuit anyway to avoid a long, expensive court battle.</p>
<p>Here's what the settlement does:</p>
<p>✅ Pays cash to people whose info was exposed<br />
✅ Requires Gryphon to beef up their security (so this hopefully doesn't happen again)<br />
✅ Provides credit monitoring and identity theft protection  </p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> The court hasn't approved this settlement yet. There's a hearing on August 31, 2026. But you can file your claim now.</p>
<h2>How Much Money Will I Get?</h2>
<p>Honestly? <strong>They haven't said yet.</strong></p>
<p>The settlement website just says "cash payment." The amount will depend on:<br />
- How many people file claims<br />
- How much total money is in the settlement pot<br />
- Whether you can show you actually got hurt by the breach (like if someone tried to steal your identity)</p>
<p><strong>Our guess:</strong> Probably somewhere between $50-$200 for most people, possibly more if you had actual identity theft or fraud because of the breach.</p>
<p>We'll update this article when they announce the amounts.</p>
