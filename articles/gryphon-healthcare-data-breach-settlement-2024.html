        <p>If you received a letter about a "data incident" from Gryphon Healthcare, you're likely wondering what it means and whether you should take action.</p>

        <p><strong>Short answer: Yes.</strong></p>

        <p>In July 2024, hackers accessed Gryphon Healthcare's systems and stole private medical information including Social Security numbers, health insurance data, and patient diagnoses. You can receive compensation through this class action settlement regardless of which state you live in.</p>

        <p>Here's what you need to know about who's eligible and how to file your claim.</p>

          <ul class="space-y-2 list-none p-0">
            <li><strong>What happened:</strong> Hackers broke into Gryphon Healthcare's system in July 2024 and stole medical records</li>
            <li><strong>What was exposed:</strong> Names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, medical diagnoses, prescriptions, insurance info</li>
            <li><strong>Who can file:</strong> Anyone whose info was in the breach (you probably got a letter) - <strong>nationwide, not just Texas</strong></li>
            <li><strong>What you get:</strong> Cash payment (amount not announced yet)</li>
            <li><strong>Deadline:</strong> April 16, 2026</li>

        <div class="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg p-5 mb-8">
          <p class="text-sm mb-0"><strong>Who this affects:</strong> This healthcare data breach settlement covers patients nationwide whose protected health information (PHI) was exposed when cybercriminals accessed Gryphon Healthcare's systems. If you received a notice about the July 2024 security incident involving your medical billing records, you're entitled to compensation under this class action settlement agreement.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What Is Gryphon Healthcare?</h2>

        <p>Gryphon Healthcare is a medical billing company that works behind the scenes for doctors' offices and hospitals across the country.</p>

        <p><strong>What they do:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Handle medical billing paperwork</li>
          <li>Send bills to insurance companies</li>
          <li>Process patient payment information</li>
          <li>Manage medical record data for healthcare providers</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Because of this role, Gryphon had access to sensitive information for a large number of patients. Unfortunately, this also made them a target for hackers.</p>

        <h2>What Information Was Stolen in the July 2024 Breach?</h2>

        <p>The data breach compromised sensitive patient information stored in Gryphon's medical billing systems.</p>

        <p><strong>Information that may have been exposed includes:</strong></p>

        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-5 mb-6">
          <ul class="space-y-1 mb-0">
            <li>Full name</li>
            <li>Date of birth</li>
            <li>Home address</li>
            <li><strong>Social Security number</strong></li>
            <li>Medical diagnoses</li>
            <li>Prescription medications</li>
            <li>Health insurance information</li>
            <li>Medical appointment dates</li>
            <li>Medical record numbers</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>If you received treatment from any healthcare provider that used Gryphon for billing services, your private health data may have been accessed without authorization.</p>

        <h2>Am I Affected? How Do I Know?</h2>

        <p><strong>If you received a letter from Gryphon Healthcare, you're affected.</strong></p>

        <p>The letter likely mentioned a "Notice of Data Incident" or similar language. Here's what to do:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Got a letter?</strong> You're eligible to file a claim</li>
          <li><strong>Didn't get a letter?</strong> Check the settlement website to see if your information was included</li>
          <li><strong>Unsure?</strong> If you visited a doctor or hospital that uses Gryphon for billing between 2019-2024, you may still be eligible</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Do I Have to Live in Texas to File a Claim?</h2>

        <p><strong>No.</strong> This is an important clarification:</p>

        <div class="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-lg p-5 mb-6">
          <p class="mb-3"><strong>You can file a claim from anywhere in the United States.</strong></p>
          
          <p class="mb-3">The lawsuit was filed in Texas court (Harris County), but that's just where the legal case is being heard. It doesn't limit who can file a claim.</p>

          <p class="mb-0">Gryphon handled medical billing for healthcare providers across the country, so the breach affected people nationwide. If your information was in their system, you're eligible—whether you live in Texas, California, New York, or any other state.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What's the Settlement About?</h2>

        <p>A class action lawsuit was filed against Gryphon Healthcare alleging that the company failed to adequately protect patient medical information.</p>

        <p><strong>The allegations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Failed to implement proper data security measures</li>
          <li>Did not adequately protect sensitive patient information</li>
          <li>Took too long to notify affected individuals about the breach</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Gryphon has not admitted any wrongdoing but agreed to settle the lawsuit to avoid prolonged litigation.</p>

        <p><strong>What the settlement provides:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cash payments to affected individuals</li>
          <li>Enhanced security measures to prevent future breaches</li>
          <li>Free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-lg p-4 mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm mb-0"><strong>Important:</strong> The court hasn't approved this settlement yet. There's a final approval hearing scheduled for August 31, 2026. However, you can file your claim now.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>How Much Money Will I Get?</h2>

        <p><strong>The exact payment amount has not been announced yet.</strong></p>

        <p>The amount each person receives will depend on several factors:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Total number of people who file claims</li>
          <li>Total settlement fund amount</li>
          <li>Whether you experienced actual harm from the breach (such as identity theft)</li>
          <li>Documentation you can provide showing damages</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Estimated range:</strong> Based on similar data breach settlements, most people will likely receive between $50-$200. Those who can document actual identity theft or fraud may receive more.</p>

        <p>We'll update this article when payment amounts are announced.</p>

          <li>Print and complete it</li>
          <li>Mail it to the Settlement Administrator at the address listed on the form</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> The online form is faster and you'll receive immediate confirmation that your claim was submitted successfully.</p>

        <h2>What If I Don't Want to Participate?</h2>

        <p>You have the option to "opt out" of the settlement, which means:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>You will not receive any payment from this settlement</li>
          <li>You keep your right to sue Gryphon Healthcare independently</li>
          <li>You can hire your own lawyer (at your own expense)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Opt-out deadline:</strong> March 17, 2026</p>

        <p>For most people, filing a claim and accepting the settlement payment is the better option.</p>

        <h2>Can I Object to the Settlement?</h2>

        <p>Yes. If you believe the settlement isn't fair or adequate, you can file an objection with the court.</p>

        <p><strong>To object:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Write a letter to the court explaining your concerns</li>
          <li>Mail it to the address provided on the settlement website</li>
          <li>Submit by <strong>March 17, 2026</strong></li>
        </ol>

        <p>You can also attend the Final Approval Hearing on August 31, 2026 to voice your objection in person.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can file a claim even if you object to the settlement.</p>

        <h2>Should You File a Claim?</h2>

        <p><strong>Our recommendation: Yes.</strong></p>

        <p>Here's why:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>It's quick:</strong> Filing takes approximately 10 minutes</li>
          <li><strong>It's free:</strong> No cost to file a claim</li>
          <li><strong>You get compensated:</strong> Even a modest payment is better than nothing</li>
          <li><strong>Free protection services:</strong> Credit monitoring and identity theft protection are included</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Given that your Social Security number and medical information may have been exposed, taking advantage of the free credit monitoring service is advisable even if you're not concerned about the cash payment.</p>

        <h2>Credit Monitoring and Identity Theft Protection</h2>

        <p>The settlement includes complimentary services to help protect you from potential identity theft:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Free credit monitoring</li>
          <li>Identity theft protection services</li>
          <li>Fraud detection alerts</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>How to enroll:</strong> Instructions should be included in your notice letter or available on the settlement website. We recommend enrolling even if you don't plan to file a claim for cash payment.</p>
