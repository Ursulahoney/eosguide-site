        <div class="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg p-5 mb-8">
          <p class="text-sm mb-0"><strong>Important:</strong> This settlement covers patient privacy violations related to website tracking technologies (Meta Pixel and Google Analytics). It does not involve a data breach or unauthorized access to Legacy Health's medical record systems.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What Is Legacy Health?</h2>
        <p>Legacy Health is a nonprofit healthcare system serving Oregon and Southwest Washington. The organization operates:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Seven hospitals</li>
          <li>Over 90 clinics and medical offices</li>
          <li>Multiple specialty care centers</li>
          <li>Patient portal system (MyHealth Online)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Legacy Health's service area primarily covers the Portland metropolitan area and surrounding communities in Oregon and Vancouver, Washington.</p>

        <h2>What Were the Allegations Against Legacy Health?</h2>
        <p>A class action lawsuit filed by Katherine Layman alleged that Legacy Health embedded third-party tracking tools on its patient portal website without patient knowledge or consent.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The tracking tools in question:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Meta Pixel</strong> (formerly Facebook Pixel) - tracking code from Meta/Facebook</li>
          <li><strong>Google Analytics</strong> - website analytics tool from Google</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What information was allegedly shared:</strong></p>
        <div class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-5 mb-6">
          <ul class="space-y-1 mb-0">
            <li>Patient portal login activity</li>
            <li>Pages viewed within the patient portal</li>
            <li>Medical conditions searched or viewed</li>
            <li>Appointment scheduling information</li>
            <li>Prescription refill requests</li>
            <li>Other patient portal interactions</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>The lawsuit claimed this information could be linked to patients' Facebook or Google accounts, allowing these companies to identify specific individuals and their health-related activities.</p>

        <p><strong>Legal claims alleged:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Breach of confidence</li>
          <li>Breach of implied contract</li>
          <li>Unjust enrichment</li>
          <li>Negligence</li>
          <li>Violation of Electronic Communications Privacy Act</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Legacy Health's response:</strong> Legacy Health denies all allegations and any wrongdoing. The settlement is not an admission of liability. Legacy agreed to settle to avoid the cost and uncertainty of continued litigation.</p>

            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">You must be a U.S. resident, but Legacy Health primarily operates in Oregon and Vancouver, Washington. If you were a patient who used their patient portal, you likely lived in or near these areas.</p>

        <h2>Should You File a Claim?</h2>
        <p><strong>Our recommendation: Yes, especially for the Medical Shield Complete service.</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>Reasons to participate:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Quick process:</strong> Filing takes approximately 5-10 minutes</li>
          <li><strong>No cost:</strong> Filing a claim is completely free</li>
          <li><strong>Valuable privacy protection:</strong> The Medical Shield Complete service alone is worth approximately $374</li>
          <li><strong>Cash payment:</strong> Even $15 is better than nothing</li>
          <li><strong>No downside:</strong> You give up nothing by participating except the theoretical right to sue Legacy Health on these specific claims</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>The Medical Shield Complete service is particularly valuable if:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your patient portal activity included sensitive health information</li>
          <li>You want to monitor for potential identity theft</li>
          <li>You're concerned about your health information being used for targeted advertising</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Understanding the Settlement Amount</h2>
        <p>The total settlement fund is $2.2 million, which will be distributed as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Court-approved attorneys' fees and costs</li>
          <li>Settlement administration expenses</li>
          <li>$2,500 service award to the class representative (Katherine Layman)</li>
          <li>Medical Shield Complete services for all class members</li>
          <li>Cash payments to class members who file claims</li>
        </ul>

        <p>With approximately 1.2 million class members, the $15 per person payment is the maximum available after other expenses are paid.</p>

        <h2>What About Future Privacy Protections?</h2>
        <p>As part of the settlement, Legacy Health has agreed to enhanced data privacy practices, though specific details are outlined in the settlement agreement.</p>
        <p>This settlement is part of a larger trend of healthcare providers being held accountable for using third-party tracking tools that may share protected health information without proper consent.</p>
