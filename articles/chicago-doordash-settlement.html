<p><strong>Deadline: March 30, 2026</strong></p>
<p><em>Last Updated: February 8, 2026</em></p>
<p>The City of Chicago has reached an <strong>$18 million settlement</strong> with DoorDash over allegations that the food delivery giant engaged in deceptive business practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. If you owned or operated a small Chicago restaurant that appeared on DoorDash or Caviar <strong>without your permission</strong> between August 2019 and November 2025, you could be eligible for a cash payment.  </p>
<h2>Quick Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Settlement Amount</strong>: $18 million total</li>
<li><strong>Your Potential Payment</strong>: Up to $2,500 per eligible restaurant</li>
<li><strong>Claim Deadline</strong>: March 30, 2026</li>
<li><strong>Who Qualifies</strong>: Chicago restaurants with 9 or fewer locations listed without consent</li>
<li><strong>Official Website</strong>: <a href="https://www.chicagodoordashsettlement.com/">ChicagoDoorDashSettlement.com</a></li>
<li><strong>Claims Administrator</strong>: Atticus Administration</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Was DoorDash Accused Of?</h2>
<p>The City of Chicago filed a lawsuit in 2021 alleging DoorDash violated the Chicago Municipal Code through several deceptive practices:</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Listing Restaurants Without Permission</strong></h3>
<p>DoorDash added hundreds of Chicago restaurants to its platform without any contractual agreement or consent from the restaurant owners. This meant businesses appeared on the app without their knowledge, potentially damaging their reputation if orders were mishandled.</p>
<h3>2. <strong>The Misleading "Chicago Fee"</strong></h3>
<p>After Chicago capped delivery fees at 15%, DoorDash added a <strong>$1.50 "Chicago Fee"</strong> to customer orders. The city alleged this fee was misleading because it suggested the charge was government-mandated when it was actually a DoorDash surcharge.</p>
<h3>3. <strong>Hidden Menu Price Markups</strong></h3>
<p>Customers weren't told that menu prices on DoorDash were often <strong>higher than ordering directly</strong> from the restaurant. This lack of transparency meant diners paid more without realizing it.</p>
<h3>4. <strong>Tip Misrepresentation</strong></h3>
<p>DoorDash used customer tips to <strong>subsidize driver wages</strong> rather than adding tips on top of base pay. Customers believed their entire tip went to drivers, but DoorDash actually reduced its own payment to drivers by the tip amount—sometimes paying drivers as little as $1 plus tips.</p>
<h3>5. <strong>Hidden Fees</strong></h3>
<p>Service fees, small order fees, and delivery charges were grouped with taxes in a way that obscured the true cost until checkout.</p>
<h2>Who Is Eligible for Payment?</h2>
<p>You may qualify for the settlement if <strong>ALL</strong> of the following apply:</p>
<p>✅ You owned or operated a restaurant in Chicago<br>
✅ Your restaurant had <strong>9 or fewer locations</strong> under a common business name<br>
✅ DoorDash or Caviar listed your restaurant <strong>without a contract</strong> between <strong>August 27, 2019, and November 14, 2025</strong><br>
✅ You <strong>do NOT currently have</strong> a contractual agreement with DoorDash or Caviar<br>
✅ Your business name and address appear on the official notice of eligibility</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: If you initially appeared without consent but later signed up with DoorDash and are still an active partner, you're eligible for delivery commission credits instead of cash payment.</p>
<h2>How Much Will Eligible Restaurants Receive?</h2>
<p>The settlement allocates funds as follows:</p>

Recipient | Amount | Details
-- | -- | --
Restaurants listed without consent (not current partners) | $3.25 million | Up to $2,500 per restaurant
Current DoorDash partner restaurants | $5.8 million | Delivery commission & marketing credits
Chicago DoorDash users | $4 million | Automatic credits (starting Jan 28, 2026)
Delivery drivers (Sept 2019) | $500,000 | Supplemental payment
City of Chicago | $4.5 million | Legal fees


<h2>DoorDash's Response</h2>
<p>DoorDash released a statement saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We're pleased to have settled this years-old lawsuit with the City of Chicago. To be clear, this settlement isn't an admission of wrongdoing and the allegations in this lawsuit focus on business practices that no longer exist."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company noted that:</p>
<ul>
<li>They stopped listing restaurants without permission years ago</li>
<li>The tip-subsidy practice ended in 2019</li>
<li>The "Chicago Fee" is no longer charged</li>
<li>They've improved transparency around pricing</li>
</ul>
<h2>What This Means for Small Restaurants</h2>
<p>This settlement represents Chicago's commitment to protecting small businesses from unfair practices. During the pandemic, third-party delivery apps became essential for restaurant survival, but many restaurants felt exploited by high fees (often 30% of order totals) and lack of control.</p>
<p>Mayor Brandon Johnson stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This settlement demonstrates Chicago's commitment to standing up for workers and small businesses while maintaining a fair and honest marketplace. Our hospitality industry is critical to our economy, and it works best when companies play by the rules."</p>
